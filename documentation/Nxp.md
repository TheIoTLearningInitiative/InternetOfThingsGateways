# NXP

> The NXP modular IoT Gateway reference design enables large node networks (LNNs) with pre-integrated, tested and RF certified support for a wide array of wireless communications protocols including: Thread, ZigBee and Wi-Fi. This range of capability allows developers to easily build gateways based on this solution, using their choice of wireless protocols for end-to-end wireless communications in LNN configurations with supporting cloud options such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
