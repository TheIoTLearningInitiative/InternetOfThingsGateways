## Getting Started with Intel® IoT Gateways with Intel® IoT Developer Kit 3.5

> This guide contains all the information you need to assemble your own commercial developer kit, from the hardware components you'll need to the software you'll use to communicate with each component of your project.

> With the release of Intel® IoT Developer Kit version 3.5, Intel now provides support for projects built using an Intel® IoT gateway -- a component that connects devices for generating intelligence without replacing existing infrastructure. Intel® IoT gateways can make use of the MRAA and UPM libraries, and communicate with a wide range of sensors and actuators via the Arduino 101* board. You can create applications for your gateway using the Node-RED* visual programming language. You can also connect and transfer code to your gateway from the Intel® XDK IoT Edition (for JavaScript*) or Intel® System Studio IoT Edition (for C/C++ or Java), available as part of the Intel IoT Developer Kit.
