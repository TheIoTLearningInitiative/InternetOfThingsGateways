## Internet of Things

> Billion of devices get connected, shared data and get optimized what they based on analyzing that data, having connectivity, security and manageability


## Gateways

> Can enable existing devices to become smart and connected

> They are the solution for the IoT industry, these are devices that connect all the things we are making smart to the cloud and the internet so we have a solid solution.

> Pre-integrated, pre-validated hardware & software building blocks. They enable secure data flow between devices and the cloud.

> can filter data from different types of sensors and protocols.

Intel Gateways are preconfigured with Wind River Helix Device Cloud agent, it provides easy connectivity to facilitate device configuration, data capture, file transfers, etc.

## Some Ideas

Gateways

- Can reduce the cost of backend cloud
- Reduce latency, actions executed immediately
- Prefer having data locally than in the cloud
- Protocol Consolidation

- Edge to Cloud Connectivity
- Remote I/O
- Scalability
- Support for multiple protocols
- Application Software
