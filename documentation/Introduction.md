## Internet of Things

> Billion of devices get connected, shared data and get optimized what they based on analyzing that data, having connectivity, security and manageability


## Gateways

> Can enable existing devices to become smart and connected

> They are the solution for the IoT industry, these are devices that connect all the things we are making smart to the cloud and the internet so we have a solid solution.

> Pre-integrated, pre-validated hardware & software building blocks. They enable secure data flow between devices and the cloud.

> can filter data from different types of sensors and protocols.


### IoT Use Cases

#### Adaptive Analytics

> Refine operational enterprise processes based on insights gained from analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data

**Transportation** Smart control systems can tell trains to slow down based on a variety of constantly changing external data inputs, such as weather, topography, location, distance from destination, track conditions, or car-to-car communication indicating another train is ahead.

**Energy** Devices can adjust the speed and blade pitch of wind turbines to improve efficiency and reduce wear.

**Buildings ** Adaptive analytics can improve the accuracy and performance of systems used to monitor and manage energy consumption, climate control, lighting, mechanical equipment and security.

#### Predictive Maintenance

> Optimize equipment uptime and performance while reducing the time and labor associated with inspections and preventive maintenance.

**Transportation** Predictive maintenance will reduce the need to remove transit vehicles, rail cars, or planes from service for routine inspections and scheduled maintenance. Instead, operators will be alerted when a piece of equipment requires attention.

**Energy** Operators can monitor generators, transformers, wind turbines, and other critical equipment from central locations and take action to mitigate stress, overheating, and other malfunctions.

**Buildings** Sensors in a building’s electrical and mechanical systems, such as lighting, climate control, plumbing, or security, will alert engineers when a part or component needs attention, enabling maintenance crews and contractors to focus on imminent issues rather than around-the-clock inspection and monitoring.

**Energy** Complete power management tasks with finer precision and faster response times, resulting in energy conservation, usage prioritization, and better outage response.

**Healthcare** Collect, compile, and analyze precise and objective data on cloud-connected smart devices to improve treatment and services in hospitals, doctors' offices, and homes.


#### Transportation

> Leverage wireless networks and cloud-based control systems to optimize performance and make immediate critical decisions to improve safety and reliability.

> Real-time equipment tracking: Cloud-based central control systems will enable operators to pinpoint any piece of equipment.

• Inter-equipment communication: Much as PTC helps avert rail accidents, planes can report turbulence to other planes, alerting pilots to take appropriate precautions; urban mass transit vehicles can report traffic delays or accidents.
• Predictive maintenance: Rather than simply alerting drivers, vehicles will transmit defect data directly to engineers. Predictive maintenance will identify components in need of repair, eliminating the need to take equipment out of service for routine inspections and preventive maintenance.
• Remote upgrades: Operators can upgrade software over the air in hundreds of connected devices spread across hundreds of vehicles simultaneously.
• Fuel management: System operators will have better visibility into fuel consumption and efficiency, potentially saving millions in fuel costs.
• Improved passenger comfort and convenience: Carriers can offer more onboard amenities. Transit riders can know how soon the next bus is coming. Air travelers can be alerted to delays via their mobile devices before they leave for the airport.
• Safety: Connected devices in vehicles must be able to receive software upgrades and patches in ways that do not impede their safe operation.
