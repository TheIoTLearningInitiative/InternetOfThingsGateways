## Internet of Things

> Billion of devices get connected, shared data and get optimized what they based on analyzing that data, having connectivity, security and manageability


## Gateways

> Can enable existing devices to become smart and connected

> They are the solution for the IoT industry, these are devices that connect all the things we are making smart to the cloud and the internet so we have a solid solution.

> Pre-integrated, pre-validated hardware & software building blocks. They enable secure data flow between devices and the cloud.

> can filter data from different types of sensors and protocols.


### Uses

#### Adaptive Analytics

> Refine operational enterprise processes based on insights gained from analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of data

**Transportation** Smart control systems can tell trains to slow down based on a variety of constantly changing external data inputs, such as weather, topography, location, distance from destination, track conditions, or car-to-car communication indicating another train is ahead.

**Energy** Devices can adjust the speed and blade pitch of wind turbines to improve efficiency and reduce wear.

**Buildings ** Adaptive analytics can improve the accuracy and performance of systems used to monitor and manage energy consumption, climate control, lighting, mechanical equipment and security.

#### Predictive Maintenance

> Optimize equipment uptime and performance while reducing the time and labor associated with inspections and preventive maintenance.

**Transportation** Predictive maintenance will reduce the need to remove transit vehicles, rail cars, or planes from service for routine inspections and scheduled maintenance. Instead, operators will be alerted when a piece of equipment requires attention.

**Energy** Operators can monitor generators, transformers, wind turbines, and other critical equipment from central locations and take action to mitigate stress, overheating, and other malfunctions.

**Buildings** Sensors in a buildingâ€™s electrical and mechanical systems, such as lighting, climate control, plumbing, or security, will alert engineers when a part or component needs attention, enabling maintenance crews and contractors to focus on imminent issues rather than around-the-clock inspection and monitoring.

**Energy** Complete power management tasks with finer precision and faster response times, resulting in energy conservation, usage prioritization, and better outage response.

**Healthcare** Collect, compile, and analyze precise and objective data on cloud-connected smart devices to improve treatment and services in hospitals, doctors' offices, and homes.
