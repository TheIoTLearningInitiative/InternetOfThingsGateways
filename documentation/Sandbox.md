Connectivity is critical to generating intelligence.

Intel Gateway Solutions for IoT provides:

- Connectivity up to the cloud and enterprises
- Connectivity down to sensors and existing controllers embedded in the system
- Preprocess filtering of selected data for delivery
- Local decision-making, enabling easy connectivity to legacy systems
- A hardware root of trust, data encryption, attestation, and software lockdown for security
- Local computing for in-device analytics.




In the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud-connected smart devices will
give manufacturers an alternative means of collecting, compiling,
and analyzing precise and objective data on device performance,
thereby reducing the time and expense of trial and accelerating
time-to-market. 



Smart Buildings
Transform and protect the home and office by designing in building automation features such as intelligence, modularity, and security.
• Energy savings: Integrated with the smart energy grid, smart
buildings and homes represent a huge opportunity to reduce
power consumption by businesses and families. Power providers
can take advantage of efficiencies based on the schedules and
usage patterns of building inhabitants. Smart power meters and
appliances will communicate with intelligent power sources to
help balance supply and demand. Green buildings, LEED certification,
and net-zero energy consumption will become increasingly
commonplace.
• Remote monitoring and control: Building operators and residential
consumers will be able to monitor utility consumption
and control heating, lighting, safety, and security systems from
offsite. For commercial buildings, that means being able to
monitor multiple properties from a centralized property management
location, communicate to onsite maintenance crews,
and take control of systems in a fire or other emergency.
• Predictive maintenance: Sensors in a building’s mechanical
components will alert engineers when a part needs attention,
reducing the time and labor costs associated with routine
inspections and preventive maintenance.
• Assisted living: As our societies’ demographics change, with
populations aging and life spans extending, the modern building
will need to support independent living at older ages. With
sensors, controllers, and intelligence, smart buildings can provide
telemedical solutions or other technical assistance for aging
people, enabling true ambient assisted living.
